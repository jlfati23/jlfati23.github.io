## Chapter 2： Culture: Symbols, Ideas, and the Stuff of life

By themselves, the sensations did not make me do anything. I responded to the word and what they meant to me.

When I used words to make what I heard and saw mean something, I constructed a reality on top of the physical sensations.

We tend to think that we live in the world as it ‘really’ is. When I hear a rumble and think ‘thunder,’ it doesn’t occur to me in that moment that I’m involved in a creative process. I don’t realize that I am choosing a word and using it to attach a particular meaning to the sound. Instead, I act as though the word and the sound are one and the same thing - that is, the sound *is* ‘thunder’.

In other words, the reality that really matters to me is not the sound itself - the moving air that hits my eardrum - but the words and ideas I use to describe that reality and make it mean something. And that reality is something I carry inside my head. If I used different words to describe the sound - say, ‘suicide bomber’ - I would create a different reality. I don’t mean I create the reality itself when I name it. It is whatever it is. What I do construct is what I think the sound *mean*  and therefore what it *is* to me, and I use words to do so.

Where do I get the words and the ideas that go along with them that prompt me to do one thing rather than another? The answer is that I participate in a society that has a *culture,* and the culture contains words and ideas that people use to name and interpret what they experience.

One of the most remarkable things about human beings is our ability to use culture to create the world we actually live in, to make up our world from scratch.Most of what we take for reality consists not of things as they ‘really’ are but of ideas people have developed about things as they think they are. Culture is where all those ideas wind up, and culture is what we look to for the tools we need to make sense of things, including ourselves.

### Constructing Reality

Culture consists primarily of symbols—especially the words contained in language—and various kinds of ideas that shape how we think about everything from relationships with other people to the meaning of life. It also includes such practices as music, art, dance, and religious rituals. It includes how we shape the physical world around us, from using sand to make silicon that goes into computer chips to building cities to arranging flowers and plants in that familiar form known as a garden. **Culture is both material (the physical ‘stuff’ of social life) and nonmaterial (the symbols and ideas we use to think and give meaning to just about everything).**

We use symbols to name things as a way to focus our attention and build a reality to live in.

We can use language to construct all kinds of reality, including what we cannot experience through our senses. We cannot hear or smell or touch what we call love, for example, like we can a banana.

It is this way with all the words that we use, like slender threads connecting us to whatever they point to and name. The words weave a reality and then connect us to it.

In this sense, the power of symbols goes far beyond labeling things— this is a sugar maple tree, this is love, this is Einstein’s theory of relativity. Symbols are also what we use to feel connected to a reality outside ourselves. Without symbols, a great deal of what we ‘know’ and experience would not exist for us. There would be no memory of what we call the past, except in the form of sensations, such as visual imagery or smells. There would be no thinking in the present and no wondering about what we call the future.

### Beliefs: “I’ll See It When I Believe It”

The first purpose of every culture is to provide a way to know what to consider true and what to consider false, and this is what beliefs are about.

In a sense, symbols are the simplest kind of belief statement, for every dictionary definition declares that something or other is real and exists. If there is a word for something, we are much more likely to see and treat it as real.

When we string words together to make more complex beliefs, we fashion the world and our place in it.

Some years ago, W. I. Thomas and Dorothy Swain Thomas made the classic statement that when cultures define something as real, the act has real consequences, regardless of whether it is actually true.

Having a set of cultural beliefs allows us to live with a taken-for-granted sense of how things are and to treat the ‘facts’ of our existence as obvious. What we call ‘obvious,’ however, is not necessarily what is true. It is only assumed to be true beyond doubt in a particular culture. Without a sense of the obvious, social life loses its predictability, and we lose our basis for feeling secure, but the obvious also blinds us to the possibility that what is ‘obviously’ true may be false.

What we do not know often gets us into trouble, but what is right under our noses—including what we think we know but don’t—can be even more serious. We feel invested in its being true and defend it rather than asking whether we might have it wrong.

### Values, Choice, and Conflict

But many cultural ideas go beyond basic questions of fact to construct a more complex social reality. Cultural values do this by ranking things in terms of how socially desirable they are—how good or bad, better or worse, superior or inferior they are judged to be.

Values loom large in our lives because they provide a way to choose between alternatives that might otherwise appear equivalent. Almost everything we do involves a choice among different values, although the choice may come to us so easily that we are not aware of it as such.
Values do more than influence how we choose between one course of action and another, for they also affect how we perceive and treat ourselves and other people.

Values do more than influence how we choose between one course of action and another, for they also affect how we perceive and treat ourselves and other people. When values rank European above Latin American, for example, or male above female, or not having a disability above having one, people are sorted into different places in a social hierarchy of worth. This process makes such problems as privilege and oppression more than issues of seeing differences among people. It also ranks entire categories of people in ways that exclude, devalue, and oppress some and include, elevate, and privilege others. The effects of such ranking can be as monumental as the genocidal wars of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda, Darfur, or Bosnia or as subtle as a white waiter’s seating a black customer next to the kitchen door and never coming back to take an order. But in every case, what is at stake are the dignity and worth of human beings and the cultural justification of systemic patterns of privilege and oppression.
Like other aspects of culture, values tend to have a taken-for-granted quality about them. We experience them as a natural part of reality, not as socially natural part of reality, not as socially constructed ideas about reality. Our preference for what we value feels so immediate and comes so easily that we assume our particular values are a universal part of the human experience, that there was not a time or a place when people did not feel this way. For some preferences, this is probably true. Even infants would rather be warm than cold, comfortable than in pain, fed rather than hungry.

But most of what we value is what we learn to value through socialization in a particular system’s culture. A powerful way to see this is to experience cultures that promote different values than our own.

The more I see of other cultures, the more aware I am of my own culture as a culture, and the more I see that things are not just what they are but are what my culture makes them out to be. I can also see that when I make choices, I always choose from a limited range of alternatives offered by my culture. This suggests that we never truly make anything like a ‘free’ choice. As philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer puts it, when it comes to values, “We want what we will, but we don’t will what we want.”

As an individual, I can be aware that culture exists and shapes my perceptions and experience, including what I think I want. As someone born and raised in the United States, I can see how materialistic my culture is and choose to live my life differently by pursuing other values. But I will always be doing this in spite of my cultural background, as an act of going against what I was raised to value as a path of least resistance. I can expand my freedom only by liberating myself from the narrow range of choices that my culture—that any culture—offers the people who participate in it. To do this, I need to step outside the cultural framework I am used to so that I can see it as a framework, as one possibility among many. Stepping outside is an important part of what sociological practice is about, and such concepts as culture, beliefs, and values are important tools used in the process, for they point to what we are stepping outside of.

We can go against our culture, because cultures are not rigid frameworks that determine who we are and what we do. Values cannot tell us what to do in every possible situation, because most situations involve combinations of values that are impossible to predict. Instead of giving us clear rules for how to choose in every situation, values provide general guidelines for how to weigh one alternative against another. As social psychologist Roger Brown puts it, values are like rules of grammar that we use to interpret sentences that we’ve never seen before.

Values provide us with raw materials and rough guidelines for weighing alternatives, but they cannot tell us how to use them.

As part of any culture, values underlie the paths of least resistance that shape how people participate in systems. As a way to regulate people’s behavior, however, values can suggest only how we ought to behave. What they lack is something to back them up and turn them into statements about how we must behave or else. Adding the ‘or else’ to a value gives us something stronger—a norm.

### Norms, Morality, and Deviance

The difference between what is valued and desired and what is expected and required is a social consequence in the form of a reward or punishment. If you take a cultural value and turn it into a rule enforced with rewards and punishments, then you have a norm, a value with teeth that can bite if you don’t choose the path of least resistance it prescribes.

Like every aspect of culture, norms are made up. They are not what people do but ideas about what people do. Like beliefs, **norms refer to some aspect of reality**, such as the definition of murder. Like values, norms are linked to cultural judgments about what is considered more or less desirable: murder is bad, but killing to protect your country is good. Norms go a step further, however, by linking beliefs and values to social consequences that would not otherwise happen.

Norms are ideas about not only how people behave but also how they appear and, in some cases, who they are.

The use of norms to exclude and oppress entire categories of people suggests something going on that a **functionalist perspective** does not help us see. It makes sense that systems are organized in ways that regulate what people do, but it makes much less sense to argue for some kind of social need to regulate who people are in terms of such traits as the color of their skin or whether they identify as gay or straight. It is hard to see why a society would require arrangements that not only elevate and privilege some groups but also routinely inflict suffering on everyone else.

Systematic patterns of exclusion, exploitation, domination, and abuse make more sense from what is known in sociological practice as ‘the conflict perspective.’ The conflict perspective also focuses on systems but primarily as a setting for conflict around patterns of social inequality. Culture is where we get most of the ideas we use to define reality, to differentiate superior from inferior, and to identify the rules of social life. It is therefore not surprising that privileged groups use their power and influence to shape culture in their own interests, including the perpetuation of privilege.

### Attitudes: Culture as Feeling

In both cases, the contempt is more than a feeling. It is also a cultural attitude that blends belief, value, and emotion in ways that shape how we feel and behave toward people or, for that matter, the Earth, ideas, or just about anything else.

Fear is certainly an emotion, but it’s not a cultural attitude unless it is connected to beliefs or values.

In one sense, then, attitudes can be primary emotions, such as fear, that are attached to various cultural beliefs and values. By itself, fear is not an attitude, but a cultural fear of snakes is. Many attitudes, however, are emotions that exist only in relation to a social context. Contempt and disgust, for example, exist only as expressions of negative judgments, and you cannot judge something without using beliefs and values.

You can teach infants to fear just about anything—a banana, a person—just by pairing it with something inherently fearful, such as violence or sudden loud noises. But you cannot teach infants to feel disgust for something, because they have no way to form ideas and judgments about anything until they learn to use language.

The mix of emotions, beliefs, and values is at the core of what makes a cultural attitude. Pride, shame, guilt, love, hate, loyalty, reverence, respect, disrespect, haughtiness, humility, pity, patriotism, sympathy, empathy, gratitude, arrogance—all exist only in relation to ideas about the object of the feeling.

### Material Culture and the Stuff of Life

What all this means for sociological practice is that to understand music or any other part of social life, we have to pay attention to its material and nonmaterial aspects and how they are related to one another. The terms of social life are not simply embodied in who we are as people but also embodied in how we shape the physical world, from the furniture we sit on to the cities and towns we live in.

Beyond our physical existence, material culture also affects the terms on which social life is lived. It affects how we perceive reality, how we feel, what we value and expect from other people, and how social relationships are structured around such issues as the distribution of power.

None of this means that the mass media control what we think about a particular issue, but they do have a great deal of control over what issues we think about. And if they can control whether we see something like capitalism as an issue, they do not have to worry about how we see it as an issue. In this sense, the most profound use of media power is not in what is printed, filmed, or broadcast but in what is not. It’s no wonder that even as major social problems, such as privilege and oppression and chronic economic insecurity, affect more and more people, it does not occur to the media to ask how a system as powerful and pervasive as capitalism might be part of the problem.

Clearly the problem has less to do with the existence of material culture, such as the printing press or television camera or Internet server, than it does with how this culture is used in a particular system. If we overlook the difference between the thing and how it’s used, material culture can take on a life of its own, as if it has power over us all by itself. Computers, for example, take a lot of blame for supposedly controlling people’s lives, but the problem is not the machine. The problem is in our relationship to the machine and how we think about it, both of which we control more than we know. A computer is, after all, just metal and plastic and amounts to nothing more than that unless someone plugs it in, turns it on, and tells it what to do. As such, a computer is nothing more than what we make it to be and has no more significance than we choose to give it.

The stuff of material culture cannot tell us what it is about. For that, we have to see where material culture fits in a social system; how people perceive, value, and think about it; and what they do with it. As such, material culture can take social life in many different directions at once. The computer, for example, can be used as an instrument of oppressive control. It can store enormous amounts of personal information about people and be used to invade their privacy and monitor their every movement in the workplace and beyond.

Although material culture gets relatively little attention in sociological work, it can play a complex and paradoxical role in social life. We create this material culture and make it part of our identities, and yet we often experience it as separate and external—autonomous and powerful in relation to ourselves. We tend to identify with it in the sense that we come to depend on it so heavily that we cannot imagine life without it. At the same time, we can easily forget that it’s nothing more than something human beings have made.
The danger of identifying with material culture is that we may hang onto it even when it produces terrible consequences.

### Our Box, the Best Box, the Only Box

Living inside a box that we can’t see out of makes it easy to assume that other cultures either don’t exist or, if they do, are either just like ours or not worth the bother of getting to know, a phenomenon known as ‘ethnocentrism.’ We are like infants who see themselves and their experience as the center of the universe and with no awareness that there might be anything else beyond what we know.

In complex societies, dominant groups often act as though the cultural ideas they use to construct reality apply to everyone.

In this sense, culture can take us in two directions at once. It can take us inward, into the limited space of our particular cultural box. But as tools for sociological practice, such concepts as culture and ethnocentrism also point to the box itself and toward the powerful experience of imagining ourselves inside and outside at the same time.
