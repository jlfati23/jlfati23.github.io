## Closer by Greg Egan

[Closer — Greg Egan](https://www.gregegan.net/MISC/CLOSER/Closer.html)

---
Assuming that other people existed, how did they apprehend that existence? How did they experience *being?* Could I ever truly understand what consciousness was like for another person – any more than I could for an ape, or a cat, or an insect? If not, I was alone.

---
I was *alone*, and it was farcical to go through the charade of pretending otherwise.

---
No literature, no poetry, no drama, however personally resonant I found it, could ever quite convince me that I’d glimpsed the author’s soul. Language had evolved to facilitate cooperation in the conquest of the physical world, not to describe subjective reality. Love, anger, jealousy, resentment, grief – all were defined, ultimately, in terms of external circumstances and observable actions. When an image or metaphor rang true for me, it proved only that I shared with the author a set of definitions, a culturally sanctioned list of word associations.

---
And I knew, now, that what Sian had always wanted most in a lover was the alien, the unknowable, the mysterious, the opaque. The whole point, for her, of being with someone else was the sense of confronting *otherness*. Without it, she believed, you might as well be talking to yourself.

---
Of course, most of the time, nothing could have mattered less. We were happy enough together, whether or not we were strangers – and whether or not my “happiness” and Sian’s “happiness” were in any real sense the same. 
Over the years, she became less self-contained, more open. She had no great dark secrets to share, no traumatic childhood ordeals to recount, but she let me in on her petty fears and her mundane neuroses. I did the same, and even, clumsily, explained my peculiar obsession. She wasn’t at all offended. Just puzzled.

“What could it actually mean, though? To know what it’s like to be someone else? You’d have to have their memories, their personality, their body – everything. And then you’d just be them, not yourself, and you wouldn’t know anything. It’s nonsense.”

I shrugged. “Not necessarily. Of course, perfect knowledge would be impossible, but you can always get closer. Don’t you think that the more things we do together, the more experiences we share, the closer we become?”

She scowled. “Yes, but that’s not what you were talking about five seconds ago. Two years, or two thousand years, of ‘shared experiences’ seen through different eyes means nothing. However much time two people spent together, how could you know that there was even the briefest instant when they both experienced what they were going through ‘together’ in the same way?”

“I know, but ... ”

“If you admit that what you want is impossible, maybe you’ll stop fretting about it.”

I laughed. “Whatever makes you think I’m as rational as that?”
