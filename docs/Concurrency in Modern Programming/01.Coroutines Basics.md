## Basic Concepts

Coroutine Scope : create and run coroutines, provides lifecycle events

Context - the Scope provides a context in which the coroutine runs

Suspending functions - functions that can be run in a coroutine (can be suspended)

Jobs - a handle on a coroutine

Deferred - a future result of a coroutine

Dispatcher - manages which thread(s) the coroutine runs on



### Scope

Coroutine Scope provides lifecycle methods for coroutines allow us to start and stop coroutines.



**Ways to start coroutine scope**:

1. **`runBlocking {}`**:
    1. Starts a **coroutine scope** and a coroutine that **blocks the current thread** until all tasks within the scope are completed.
    2. Often used in **main functions** or **tests** where you want to wait for coroutines to complete.
    3. if you use `runBlocking` to launch a coroutine scope **without specifying a dispatcher**, the coroutine will run on the **main thread** (or whichever thread `runBlocking` is called on).

2. **`CoroutineScope {}`**:
    1. Starts a **coroutine scope** without blocking the current thread. It's used when you want to define a custom scope but don't want to block.
    2. The scope runs asynchronously and needs to be manually managed (cancelled when needed).

3. **`GlobalScope {}`**:
    1. A global **coroutine scope** that is not tied to any lifecycle. Coroutines started here run until they complete or are explicitly cancelled.
    2. **Not recommended** for most cases due to lack of structured concurrency.

4. **`lifecycleScope {}` / `viewModelScope {}`** (Android-specific):

    1. These scopes are tied to Android components like Activities, Fragments, or ViewModels. They are automatically cancelled when the lifecycle component is destroyed.



**Summary**:

1. **`runBlocking`**:Blocking scope, often used in testing or main functions.
2. **`CoroutineScope`**: Non-blocking, custom scope that can be manually managed.
3. **`GlobalScope`**: Non-blocking, global scope (not tied to a lifecycle, avoid unless necessary).
4. **`lifecycleScope` / `viewModelScope`**: Lifecycle-aware coroutine scopes for Android components.



### Context

A context is **a set of data** that relates to the coroutine.

All coroutines have an associated context.

A **coroutine context** is essentially a set of elements that define various aspects of how a coroutine should behave, such as:

- **Dispatcher**: Specifies the thread or thread pool the coroutine should run on (e.g., `Dispatchers.Main`, `Dispatchers.IO`).
- **Job**: Controls the lifecycle of the coroutine. It allows you to cancel or manage the coroutine.
- **CoroutineName**: Assigns a name to the coroutine for debugging purposes.

A coroutine context can consist of multiple elements combined together. You can retrieve the current context inside a coroutine using `coroutineContext`.



`withContext` is a suspending function that allows you to **switch the context** (e.g., change dispatcher) within a coroutine **while keeping the coroutine alive**. It is commonly used for switching from one dispatcher to another, such as from a background thread to the main thread, to perform a specific task.

When the block inside `withContext` finishes, **the coroutine returns to the previous context**. `withContext` is useful when you need to switch threads for specific tasks, like moving computation to `Dispatchers.IO` and updating the UI on `Dispatchers.Main`.



### Suspending Function

A **suspending function** in Kotlin is a special type of function that can be **paused** and **resumed** without blocking the current thread. It's designed to work with Kotlin's coroutines and can be called only from within another suspending function or a coroutine.



**Key Characteristics of a Suspending Function:**

1. **Marked with `suspend`:** A suspending function is defined with the `suspend` keyword, which tells Kotlin that the function can suspend execution and resume later.
2. **Non-blocking:** Even though the function suspends (pauses) its execution, it **does not block the thread**. This allows other coroutines to continue running on the same thread while the suspending function waits.
3. **Can Call Other Suspending Functions:** A suspending function can only be called from another suspending function or from inside a coroutine (using `launch`, `async`, `runBlocking`, etc.).



**Where Suspending Functions Are Used:**

- **Network calls**: Fetching data from a remote server can be written as a suspending function because it may take time to get a response, but you don’t want to block the thread.
- **I/O operations**: Reading or writing to a file can suspend the function while waiting for the operation to complete.
- **Asynchronous tasks**: Any task that takes time to complete can be made a suspending function, allowing other tasks to run while waiting.



**Why Use Suspending Functions?**

- **Efficiency:** They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, but without blocking the thread.
- **Concurrency:** Multiple coroutines can run concurrently on the same thread without interfering with each other, thanks to suspending functions.

In summary, a **suspending function** is the building block of coroutines in Kotlin, allowing you to write non-blocking, asynchronous code easily.



The `delay` function is a suspending function that pauses the execution of the coroutine without blocking the thread. It is like `Thread.sleep()` but for coroutines, allowing other coroutines to run during this time.

- In traditional multi-threaded programming, when you want to pause a thread (e.g., with `Thread.sleep`), the entire thread is blocked, **meaning that the operating system prevents the thread from doing anything else during that time**. This is inefficient because the thread is essentially wasted while waiting for the sleep to finish, and the system needs to dedicate resources to keep that thread alive.

- In contrast, coroutines work differently. When you use the `delay` function in a coroutine, it **pauses** the coroutine, but **does not block the underlying thread**. Here's how:

    - **Non-blocking:** When a coroutine hits a suspending function like `delay`, it does not stop the whole thread. Instead, the coroutine "pauses" itself and the thread can continue executing other tasks or run other coroutines during the wait. Once the delay is over, the coroutine is resumed from where it paused.

    - **Efficient use of resources:** This allows a single thread to manage many coroutines, without the inefficiency of blocking threads. The system can manage multiple concurrent tasks (via coroutines) with fewer resources compared to using multiple threads.

- **Example:**Imagine you have 1000 tasks that all need to wait for a response from a server (simulating network delay). If you used traditional threads and each thread had to `sleep` while waiting, you would need 1000 threads, which is resource-heavy. However, with coroutines and `delay`, you can run these 1000 tasks on just a few threads because the coroutines yield control back to the thread when they are waiting (not blocking it).





### Job

In Kotlin Coroutines, a **`Job`** is a key concept used to represent and control the lifecycle of a coroutine. A `Job` is essentially a handle for a coroutine's lifecycle and provides mechanisms to:

- **Cancel** the coroutine
- **Track its completion**
- **Wait for its completion**



A `Job` in coroutines is a background task that can be **canceled**, **monitored**, or **joined**. Every coroutine that is launched or run returns a `Job`, which can be used to manage the coroutine’s lifecycle.

For example, when you **launch a coroutine**, a `Job` is created and returned:

```kotlin
val job = launch {
    // Coroutine work here
}
```



**Job Functions and Properties**

- **`job.cancel()`**: Cancels the coroutine. If the coroutine is running, it will attempt to stop the execution as soon as possible.

- **`job.isActive`**: Returns `true` if the coroutine is still running (or scheduled to run).

- **`job.isCompleted`**: Returns `true` if the coroutine has completed its execution (whether normally or via cancellation).

- **`job.join()`**: Suspends the calling coroutine until the `Job` completes. This is useful when you need to wait for the coroutine to finish before proceeding.



**Structured Concurrency and Jobs (Job Hierarchy)**

When you launch coroutines, you typically use **structured concurrency**. This means that coroutines are **child coroutines** of the coroutine that launched them (or the scope they were launched in).

The parent coroutine’s `Job` **tracks and controls its children**:

- If the parent job is canceled, all of its children are also canceled.
- If a child coroutine fails, it can propagate the failure to the parent.

```kotlin
val parentJob = launch {
    val childJob = launch {
        // This child coroutine is a child of parentJob
        delay(1000L)
        println("Child job finished")
    }
}
parentJob.cancel()  // This cancels both the parent and the child
```

###  

**Cancelling a** `Job`

When you call `job.cancel()`, the coroutine gets canceled, but it's important to note that cancellation is **cooperative**. This means the coroutine must **check for cancellation at certain points** (e.g., during suspending functions like `delay`, `yield`, etc.).

```kotlin
val job = launch {
    try {
        repeat(1000) { i ->
            println("Coroutine running: $i")
            delay(500L)  // Suspending function
        }
    } finally {
        println("Coroutine was cancelled")
    }
}

// Cancel after 2 seconds
delay(2000L)
job.cancel()  // Cancel the job
```

In the example, the coroutine periodically suspends on `delay()`, which is a point where cancellation can happen. When `cancel()` is called, the coroutine is canceled, and the `finally` block is executed.



**`Job` in `async` and `launch`**

- **`launch`** returns a `Job`, which represents a coroutine that doesn't return a result.
- **`async`** also returns a `Job` (but more specifically, a `Deferred`), which allows you to get a result from the coroutine using `await()`.



**Summary:**

- A **`Job`** represents the lifecycle of a coroutine.
- It allows you to **cancel**, **track** the status of a coroutine, or **wait** for it to complete.
- Jobs follow the principle of **structured concurrency**, meaning that parent coroutines manage the lifecycle of their child coroutines.
- You can use `cancel()` to stop a coroutine, and cancellation is **cooperative** (requires suspension points like `delay()` or `yield()`).

In essence, `Job` is a powerful tool in Kotlin coroutines that helps you manage the lifecycle and control the behavior of coroutines efficiently.



### Dispatchers

In Kotlin Coroutines, **`Dispatchers`** are responsible for determining which thread or thread pool the coroutine will run on. By using different **`Dispatcher`** types, you can control how your coroutine behaves in terms of concurrency, performance, and resource management.



There are four commonly used dispatchers in Kotlin:

1. **`Dispatchers.Default`**

- **Thread Pool**: Optimized for **CPU-bound tasks**, such as complex calculations, sorting, or parsing.
- **Threads**: It uses a **shared pool of background threads** based on the number of available CPU cores.
- **Use Case**: When you have **computationally intensive tasks** that don't need to interact with the UI, such as processing large datasets, running algorithms, or background operations.

Example:

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    // Heavy CPU-bound work
    val result = calculateSomething()
    println(result)
}
```

2. **`Dispatchers.IO`**

- **Thread Pool**: Optimized for **I/O-bound tasks**, such as **reading from or writing to the file system, network requests, or database operations**.
- **Threads**: It uses a pool of threads that can handle more concurrent operations than `Dispatchers.Default`, as I/O tasks tend to spend a lot of time waiting (e.g., waiting for network responses).
- **Use Case**: For tasks that involve input/output, such as interacting with files, making HTTP requests, or querying a database.

Example:

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val data = fetchDataFromNetwork()
    println(data)
}
```

3. **`Dispatchers.Main`**

- **Thread**: Confined to the **main (UI) thread** of Android or JavaFX applications.
- **Use Case**: Designed for **UI-related tasks** like updating the UI, handling user interactions, or any operation that should run on the main thread. Coroutines running on this dispatcher must be lightweight, like updating views after receiving data or handling quick UI events.

Example:

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
    // UI updates
    textView.text = "Hello, Coroutine!"
}
```

> `Dispatchers.Main` is available in Android, JavaFX, or other environments that have a main thread concept.

4. **`Dispatchers.Unconfined`**

- **Thread**: Starts executing on the **current thread**, but may later resume on a different thread after suspension. It’s not confined to a specific thread.
- **Use Case**: `Dispatchers.Unconfined` is useful in **test cases** or when a coroutine doesn't need to run on any specific thread. It’s generally not recommended for production use because it can lead to unpredictable behavior.

Example:

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
    println("Running on thread: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    delay(1000)
    println("Resumed on thread: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
}
```



**How to Use Dispatchers in Coroutines**

You can specify a dispatcher when launching a coroutine, using the `launch`, `async`, or `withContext` functions.

Example:

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
    // I/O work like reading files or making network requests
    val data = fetchDataFromNetwork()
    
    // Switch to the Main dispatcher for UI updates
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        updateUI(data)
    }
}
```



**Custom Dispatchers**

If you want more control over threading, you can create your own dispatcher using `newSingleThreadContext` or `Executors`. This is helpful when you need specific thread management or isolation.

```kotlin
val customDispatcher = newSingleThreadContext("MyThread")

launch(customDispatcher) {
    // This coroutine runs on MyThread
    println("Running on custom dispatcher")
}
```



**Summary of Dispatchers:**

- **`Dispatchers.Default`**: For CPU-bound tasks, using a thread pool based on CPU core count.
- **`Dispatchers.IO`**: For I/O-bound tasks like network calls or file reading, with an optimized thread pool for I/O operations.
- **`Dispatchers.Main`**: For UI-related tasks on the main thread.
- **`Dispatchers.Unconfined`**: Starts the coroutine on the current thread but can resume on any thread; generally not recommended for most use cases.

Each dispatcher is optimized for specific types of tasks, and you can switch between them as needed within coroutines to ensure efficient use of system resources while avoiding blocking important threads like the UI thread.



### async



In Kotlin Coroutines, `async` is used to start a **concurrent task** that returns a result. Unlike `launch`, which is used for coroutines that don't return a value, `async` returns a **`Deferred`** object, which is essentially a promise for a future result. The result can be retrieved using the `await()` function.

1. **Concurrency**: `async` allows you to run tasks in parallel or concurrently with other coroutines.
2. **Returns a Result**: `async` is used when you need to compute or fetch a value that will be returned to the caller.
3. **Non-Blocking**: The tasks launched with `async` are non-blocking. While the coroutine is running, other coroutines can proceed without waiting for it to complete.



**`async` vs `launch`**

- `launch` is **fire-and-forget**. It returns a `Job` that doesn't hold any result, and it's typically used when you don’t need to return a value (like updating the UI or logging something).
- `async` is used when you need to return a **result** after some asynchronous operation, like fetching data from a network or performing a computation.



**Example:**

Imagine you need to fetch two sets of data concurrently and combine them once both operations are complete. You can use `async` to run these tasks in parallel and then await the results.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Start two concurrent tasks using async
    val deferred1 = async { fetchData1() }
    val deferred2 = async { fetchData2() }
    
    // Wait for both results and combine them
    val result = deferred1.await() + deferred2.await()
    
    println("Combined Result: $result")
}

suspend fun fetchData1(): Int {
    delay(1000) // Simulate a long-running task
    return 10
}

suspend fun fetchData2(): Int {
    delay(2000) // Simulate another long-running task
    return 20
}
```

Breakdown:

1. **`async` Launches Concurrent Tasks**:

    - `async { fetchData1() }` starts fetching the first set of data **in a separate coroutine.**
    - `async { fetchData2() }` starts fetching the second set of data concurrently.

2. **`await()` Suspends Until the Result is Ready**:

    - `deferred1.await()` and `deferred2.await()` will suspend the **execution** until the result is ready. Once both results are available, they are combined.

   The total time taken will be close to 2 seconds (the longer of the two delays) because both tasks run concurrently.





By default, `async` starts executing the block of code immediately. However, you can make it **lazy**, meaning it will only start when you explicitly call `await()`.

```kotlin
val deferred = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) {
    // This block won't execute until `await()` is called
    fetchData()
}
```

With `CoroutineStart.LAZY`, the coroutine won’t start until you either call `await()` or explicitly invoke `start()`.



Structured Concurrency with `async`

Kotlin Coroutines follow **structured concurrency**, meaning that child coroutines are tied to the scope they are launched in. If the parent scope is cancelled, all child coroutines will also be cancelled, ensuring you don’t have background tasks running out of control.

For example:

```kotlin
val result = coroutineScope {
    val deferred1 = async { fetchData1() }
    val deferred2 = async { fetchData2() }
    
    // Both `async` coroutines will be cancelled if this scope is cancelled
    deferred1.await() + deferred2.await()
}
```

If the `coroutineScope` is cancelled, both `async` coroutines (`deferred1` and `deferred2`) are automatically cancelled.



**Summary:**

- `async` is used to start coroutines that return a result (`Deferred`).
- Use `await()` to retrieve the result of the `async` coroutine, which suspends until the result is available.
- Multiple `async` coroutines can run concurrently, making them ideal for tasks like network calls or computationally intensive operations.
- By using `lazy` start, you can defer the execution of the coroutine until necessary.
- `async` works well with structured concurrency, ensuring proper lifecycle management for parent-child coroutines.



### Exception Handling

Exception behaviour depends on the coroutine builder.

`launch`

- Propagates through the parent-child hierarchy

- The exception will be thrown immediately and jobs will fail

- use try-catch or an exception handler



`async`

- Exceptions are deferred until the result is consumed
- If the result is not consumed, the exception is never thrown
- try-catch in the coroutine or in the await() call
