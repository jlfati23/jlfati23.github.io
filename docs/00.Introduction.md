Welcome to the "Docs" section of my website! Here, you'll find a collection of topics I've encountered in my work, along
with the challenges I've aimed to solve. My interests span various subjects, and I love diving deep into each one.

To create these notes, I often watch instructional videos, browse the internet, and reference books, gathering insights
from multiple sources. From there, I restructure the information based on my own understanding, ensuring that the
content is clear and accessible.

I believe these notes reflect my journey through the world of technology. While I may someday find some of these topics
too simple, every step I take is significant. They serve as a testament to my ongoing learning and progress. I look
forward to the day when I can look back and see all my notes as "too simple," signifying how far I've come.
