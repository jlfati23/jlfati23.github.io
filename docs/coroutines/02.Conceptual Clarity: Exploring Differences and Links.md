## Coroutines vs Threads

Threads and coroutines are both mechanisms for **achieving concurrency**, but they operate at different levels and have distinct characteristics:

1. **Threads:**
    - **OS-managed:** Threads are managed **by the operating system**. Each thread takes up a significant amount of system resources (memory, CPU context switching).
    - **Blocking:** If a thread is blocked (e.g., by `Thread.sleep` or waiting for I/O), it cannot do any work until the block is over. Other threads may still run, but the blocked thread consumes system resources while waiting.
    - **Heavyweight:** Threads are relatively "heavy" in terms of resource consumption because they require separate stacks, context switching, etc. Managing a large number of threads (like thousands) can lead to performance issues due to the overhead of context switching.

2. **Coroutines:**
    - **Language-managed:** Coroutines are managed by the Kotlin runtime and the language itself rather than by the operating system. They are far more lightweight compared to threads.
    - **Non-blocking:** When a coroutine encounters a suspension point (e.g., `delay`), it suspends its execution and allows other coroutines to run, but without blocking the underlying thread. The thread remains free to run other coroutines or tasks while the coroutine is paused.
    - **Lightweight:** You can create and run thousands (or even millions) of coroutines without the overhead that comes with threads. Coroutines take minimal memory, and they only require a small stack and state to keep track of their execution.



**How Threads and Coroutines Work Together**

Coroutines can run on one or more threads. The key benefit of coroutines is that multiple coroutines can be executed on the same thread, without blocking the thread. The Kotlin coroutine dispatcher (e.g., `Dispatchers.Default`, `Dispatchers.IO`, etc.) manages how coroutines are mapped to threads.

- **Single-threaded environment:** You can run multiple coroutines on a single thread. The thread won't be blocked by any coroutine that is in a suspended state (e.g., waiting on a `delay` or an I/O operation).
- **Multi-threaded environment:** **Coroutines can be dispatched across multiple threads**, with the coroutine dispatcher handling the thread allocation.

## Ways To Start a Coroutine

Here are common ways to start a coroutine in Kotlin, each with a short explanation:

### 1. **`launch`**

- Starts a coroutine that **runs in the background** and does not return a result.

- Example:

  ```kotlin
  GlobalScope.launch {
      // Background task
  }
  ```

### 2. **`async`**

- Starts a coroutine that **returns a result** (using a `Deferred`), allowing you to await the result later.

- Example:

  ```kotlin
  val result = GlobalScope.async {
  
  }
  println(result.await()) // Waits for the result
  ```

### 3. **`runBlocking`**

- Starts a coroutine that **blocks the current thread** until it finishes. Used mainly in testing or main functions.If you use `runBlocking` to launch a coroutine scope **without specifying a dispatcher**, the coroutine will run on the **main thread** (or whichever thread `runBlocking` is called on). This is because `runBlocking` **blocks the current thread** until all the coroutines within its scope have completed, so it effectively "converts" the coroutine into blocking code.

- Example:

  ```kotlin
  runBlocking {
      // Runs on the calling thread (e.g., main thread)
  }
  ```

### 4. **`withContext`**

- Switches the context to a different dispatcher (e.g., `IO` or `Default`) and **executes a suspending function** in that context.

- Example:

  ```kotlin
  withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
      // Runs on an IO thread
  }
  ```

Each of these methods is used depending on whether you need background execution, a return value, or to block the thread.

## Corountine Scope vs Coroutine

1. **Coroutine Scope:**

    - A **coroutine scope** is a context or container that defines the lifecycle of the coroutines launched within it.

    - **Purpose:** It controls the lifecycle of coroutines and ensures that when the scope is cancelled, all coroutines within it are also cancelled.

    - It can be created using functions like `runBlocking`, `CoroutineScope`, or `GlobalScope`.

    - **Scope functions** such as `launch` and `async` are called within a coroutine scope to start individual coroutines.

   ```kotlin
runBlocking {
// This is a coroutine scope
}
   ```



2. **Coroutine:**

      - A **coroutine** is a **concurrent task** that can be suspended and resumed later without blocking the thread.

      - **Purpose:** It represents the actual task that runs in a non-blocking manner. Coroutines are launched from within a coroutine scope using functions like `launch` or `async`.

      - Multiple coroutines can be launched inside a single scope and run concurrently.

   ```kotlin
runBlocking {
    launch { // This is a coroutine
        // Task running in a coroutine
    }
}
   ```



- **Coroutine Scope:** Manages and contains coroutines. It is responsible for the **lifecycle** of the coroutines within it.
- **Coroutine:** The individual **task** that runs asynchronously within a coroutine scope.

```kotlin
runBlocking { // Coroutine scope
    // Coroutine 1
    launch {
        println("Coroutine 1")
    }

    // Coroutine 2
    launch {
        println("Coroutine 2")
    }
}
```

- **Coroutine Scope:** The `runBlocking` block defines the coroutine scope.
- **Coroutines:** The two `launch` blocks define two separate coroutines running inside the scope.

In this way, **coroutines** are tasks, and **coroutine scopes** manage the execution and lifecycle of these tasks.

----------------------------------------------------------------


## Coroutine Hierarchy

1. **Lifecycle Management**: If the parent coroutine (`runBlocking`) is cancelled, all of its child coroutines are also cancelled. In your case, if `runBlocking` were cancelled for some reason, the coroutine launched by `launch` would also be cancelled.
2. **Structured Concurrency**: Kotlin's coroutines use **structured concurrency**, which means that the lifecycle of a coroutine is bound by the scope that launched it. The parent coroutine (e.g., `runBlocking`) will not complete until all its child coroutines (e.g., those launched by `launch`) have finished. This ensures that no coroutines are left running in the background without supervision.
3. **Exception Propagation**: If an exception is thrown in a child coroutine, it will propagate to the parent coroutine unless handled explicitly in the child. This ensures that errors are not silently ignored, and parents can manage or handle errors in their children.
