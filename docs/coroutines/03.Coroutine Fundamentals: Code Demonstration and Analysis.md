## Example 1

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

suspend fun getData(): String {
    delay(3000L)
    return "Data fetched"
}

fun main() {
    runBlocking {
        println("This is running on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

        // Parent coroutine (Coroutine 1)
        val result = getData()
        println(result)
        println("Hello world")

        // Child coroutine (Coroutine 2) launched by 'launch'
        launch {
            println("This is running on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
            println(getData())
        }

        println("Hello world")
    }
}

```



- There are two coroutines and both of them are runining on thread `Main`.
- First call of `getData()` will block coroutine launched by `runBlocking{}` and the second call of it won't block the first coroutine.
- Specifically, the coroutine launched by `launch` inside `runBlocking` is a **child coroutine** of the `runBlocking` coroutine.

## Example 2

The controller method is responsible for handling the HTTP request and invoking the service method:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/data")
class DataController(private val myService: MyService) {

    @PostMapping("/updateName")
    suspend fun updateName(): ResponseEntity<String> = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        return@withContext try {
            myService.updateName() // Call the service method
            ResponseEntity.ok("Data updated successfully")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            e.printStackTrace()
            ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                .body("An error occurred while updating data")
        }
    }
}
```

The service method performs the necessary asynchronous operations, including calling external services:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

@Service
class MyService(
    private val service1: Service1,
    private val service2: Service2,
    private val service3: Service3,
    private val service4: Service4,
    private val service5: Service5,
    private val myRepository: MyRepository
) {
    suspend fun updateName(): Unit = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Call service1 first
        val data1 = async { service1.fetchData() }
        
        // Use the result of service1 to call service2
        val data2 = async { service2.fetchData(data1.await()) }
        
        // Call other services concurrently
        val data3 = async { service3.fetchData() }
        val data4 = async { service4.fetchData() }
        val data5 = async { service5.fetchData() }
        
        // Await results of all services
        val allResults = awaitAll(data1, data2, data3, data4, data5)
        
        // Use the results to save to the database
        myRepository.save(allResults)
    }
}
```



The `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` calls in the controller method and the service method each create their own coroutine contexts, but they operate within a hierarchical structure. Here’s how they relate to each other:



**Hierarchical Structure**

1. **Controller Method Coroutine Scope**:
    - **`withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`** in the controller method starts a coroutine with the IO dispatcher. This coroutine manages the execution of the controller method itself and any asynchronous tasks within it.
    - This parent coroutine will run until the method completes or an exception occurs.

2. **Service Method Coroutine Scope**:
    - **`withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`** in the service method starts a new coroutine with the IO dispatcher. This coroutine manages the execution of the service method itself and any asynchronous tasks within it.
    - This coroutine is a child of the parent coroutine created by the `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` in the controller method.



Relationship

- **Parent-Child Relationship**:
    - The coroutine context from the controller method (`withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`) is the parent coroutine scope.
    - The coroutine context from the service method (`withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`) is a child coroutine scope within the parent context.

- **Context Propagation**:
    - When the controller method calls the service method, the service method runs within the coroutine context of the controller method. This means that even though the service method starts its own coroutine context, it still operates within the broader scope initiated by the controller method.
    - The IO dispatcher specified in the service method (`withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`) ensures that both the service method and its children coroutines use the IO dispatcher.

- **Exception Handling**:
    - Exceptions thrown in the service method's coroutine will propagate up to the controller method's coroutine, unless caught within the service method.
    - The overall error handling for the HTTP request will be affected by the success or failure of the service method's coroutine execution.



Visual Representation

```
Controller Coroutine (withContext(Dispatchers.IO))
    |
    |-- Service Coroutine (withContext(Dispatchers.IO))
            |
            |-- Child Coroutines (e.g., async { service1.fetchData() })
```



**Summary**

- **The `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` in the controller method** starts the top-level coroutine that manages the request lifecycle and handles service calls.
- **The `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` in the service method** starts a new coroutine within the context of the parent coroutine, managing the service's asynchronous tasks.
- **Child coroutines** within the service method are managed by this service method's coroutine scope but are still under the broader control of the controller's coroutine scope.

This hierarchical structure helps in maintaining a clear and manageable concurrency model where each coroutine operates within its intended context while respecting dependencies and error handling.


----------------------------------------------------------------
##  Context switching and how many contexts can a coroutine have?

```kotlin
suspend fun fetchData() {
    val data = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Fetch data from network or database
        "Data"
    }
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        // Update UI with the fetched data
        println("Fetched data: $data")
    }
}

```

The code  shows how to **fetch data using one context (dispatcher)** and then **use it in another context (dispatcher/thread)**.

1. **Fetching data with one dispatcher**:
    - In the example, the network or database operation happens on `Dispatchers.IO`, which is meant for I/O tasks (like reading files or making network requests). This ensures the work is done **in a background thread**, not blocking the main thread.

2. **Using the data in another dispatcher**:
    - After fetching the data, the `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` block is used to switch back to the **Main thread** (UI thread). This is crucial for updating the UI, as UI updates are typically required to happen on the main thread in Android or similar platforms.



**Multiple Contexts in One Coroutine:**

- **A coroutine can have multiple contexts**, but **it only has one active context at a time**. When you use `withContext`, you're **temporarily switching the context** (e.g., changing dispatchers) for a block of code.

- **Contexts can be layered**. For example, a coroutine may start with `Dispatchers.Main`, then switch to `Dispatchers.IO` for a network call, and then switch back to `Dispatchers.Main` to update the UI. Each time you use `withContext`, you temporarily override the current context.

**Example:**

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
    // Initial context: Dispatchers.Main
    val data = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Temporarily switch to Dispatchers.IO for network or database fetch
        fetchDataFromNetwork()
    }
    // Back to Dispatchers.Main to update the UI
    updateUIWithData(data)
}
```

**How It Works:**

- **Coroutine starts on `Dispatchers.Main`** (main thread).
- **Switches to `Dispatchers.IO`** when calling `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` to fetch data, performing the work on a background thread.
- Once the work in `withContext` is done, it **switches back to the main context (`Dispatchers.Main`)** to update the UI.

**Multiple Context Elements:**

A coroutine context can also include other elements besides dispatchers, such as a `Job` for cancellation and control or a `CoroutineName` for debugging. But at any given time, only **one dispatcher is active** (though other context elements like `Job` might still be present).

**In summary:**

- One coroutine can work across multiple contexts (via `withContext`).
- At any point, only **one context** is active, and `withContext` allows you to **temporarily switch the dispatcher** or other context elements for specific tasks.



Actually, **your main thread won't be blocked** even if `fetchDataFromNetwork()` takes a long time, because of how **Kotlin coroutines and `withContext` work**.

Here's why:

**Key Points:**

- **`withContext` is a suspending function**: This means that when you call `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`, the current coroutine is suspended, and **control is returned to the calling thread** (in this case, the main thread) until the background work is completed.

- **No blocking**: Even though the coroutine switches to a background dispatcher (`Dispatchers.IO`) for `fetchDataFromNetwork()`, the main thread is not blocked. The suspension frees up the main thread to handle other tasks while the background operation is running on a different thread.

- When the background operation completes, **the coroutine resumes** on the original dispatcher (in this case, `Dispatchers.Main`) to continue the next steps, like updating the UI.

**How it Works:**

1. **Coroutine starts on the main thread**: When the coroutine launches with `Dispatchers.Main`, it starts on the main thread.
2. **Suspends on `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`**: When `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` is called, the coroutine switches to a background thread to fetch data. The main thread is not blocked; it's free to do other things.
3. **Background work is done on `Dispatchers.IO`**: The network operation (`fetchDataFromNetwork()`) runs on the background thread.
4. **Resumes on the main thread**: Once the network call completes, the coroutine resumes on `Dispatchers.Main` to update the UI.

**Example in Action:**

```kotlin
// Start fetching data
launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
    val data = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        fetchDataFromNetwork()  // Fetch data in the background
    }
    updateUIWithData(data)  // Update the UI when data is fetched
}

// Meanwhile, this code can still run on the main thread (for example, responding to user clicks)
button.setOnClickListener {
    println("Button clicked!")
    // Handle button click while the network request is still running in the background
}

```

- **The main thread is not blocked** during `fetchDataFromNetwork()`.
- The `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` switches the coroutine to the background thread for I/O operations.
- Once the data is fetched, the coroutine returns to the main thread, and only then will the UI be updated.

Since `withContext` **suspends the coroutine** rather than blocking it, your **main thread stays free** to handle other tasks. This is one of the key advantages of using coroutines—efficiently performing background tasks without blocking the main thread.
